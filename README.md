# European Football Database

This project utilizes the European Soccer Database, a Kaggle dataset with over 25,000 matches and 10,000 players from European professional soccer seasons between 2008 and 2016, available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prajitdatta/ultimate-25k-matches-football-database-european).

**Project Objective:**
- Create models predicting the number of goals and the winner of each match.

**Key Questions and Findings:**

**Exploration:**
- Identification of leagues and countries.
- Analysis of goal-scoring trends across leagues.
- Recognition of top scorers by team and league.
- Assessment of home advantage significance.

**Modeling:**
- Prediction of goals per team and match outcomes.
- RandomForestClassifier outperforms in predicting winners.
- Multinomial Logistic Regression achieves superior overall accuracy in goal prediction.

**Conclusions and Improvements:**
- Insights into player attributes, league-specific match counts, and goal-scoring patterns.
- Identification of top scorers, home advantage impact, and modeling performance assessments.
- Suggestions for future improvements, including seasonal attribute separation and model testing.

This analysis provides valuable insights into European football dynamics and lays the groundwork for further model enhancements.
